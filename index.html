    <div class="text2"> 
        The Green Bird Society aims to network birdwatchers and photographers alike by organising regular 
        birdwatching trips to reserves and hotspots. 
        Becoming a member will allow you to meet like-minded people whilst experiencing new animals and places, 
        and expanding the limits to your knowledge within the world of birding. 
        This society has a place for everyone who wants to explore their interests and the amazing nature that surrounds us, 
        by seeing things they've never noticed before or by appreciating the ordinary.
